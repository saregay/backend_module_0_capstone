## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A condition is a set of rules or order performed if a certain condition is met. Its also referred to as if-them statement, because if a condition is met, then an action is performed.


```x = 1
  if x>=2
   puts "x is less than 2"
 else
   puts "x is greater than 2"
end
```



```dollar = 2

if dollar == 2
  p "get tea"
end

if dollar < 2
  p "get water"
end

if dollar >= 5
  p "get coffee"
end
```


```food = "breakfast"

if food == "breakfast"
  p "cereal"
elsif food == "lunch"
  p "tuna"
elsif food == "dinner"
  p "lasagna"
end
```


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

so that if the condition is met, a fallow up action could be performed.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```If(condition1)

elsif (condition2)
  print (xy)
end
```

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```if (condition1)
elsif (condition2)
  print (xy)

end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

```x = 1
unless x>=2
   puts "x is less than 2"
 else
   puts "x is greater than 2"
end
```
